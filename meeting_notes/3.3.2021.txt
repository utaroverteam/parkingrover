Met with team last time. They have already completed all the hardware. Team will start to build base station next.

Focus for now: Research RTK GPS and Mission Planner software.

Don't worry about the budget. Just buy the stuff we need.

Dr. McMurrough doesn't think the hardware is done. Also doesn't think they will be able to finish the base station. It will be more complex than expected. And there will be a lot more functionality to work on.

more functionalities:
	GUI, UI/UX
	Athletic field re-striping
	app to control rover


RTK base station
->publish to RTK to go.

Paint spraying functionality will be implemented by our team. 

Solenoid valve (12-24volts) for controlling  paint spray. Air compressor or tank may be needed.



Suggestion: use an RC CAR for prototyping with RTK-GPS
